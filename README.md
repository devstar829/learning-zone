# Java Programs [ Arrays ]

1. How to find the missing number in integer array of 1 to 100? (solution)
This is one of the most simple array problems you will see, mostly asked in a telephonic round of Interview. You have given an integer array which contains numbers from 1 to 100 but one number is missing, you need to write a Java program to find that missing number in an array. You cannot use any open source library or Java API method which solves this problem. One trick to solve this problem is to calculate sum of all numbers in the array and compare with expected sum, the difference would be the missing number.

Array Interview Questions and Answer Java C++

2. How to find duplicate number on Integer array in Java? (solution)
An array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-2. There is exactly one number is repeated in the array. You need to write a program to find that duplicate number. For example, if an array with length 6 contains numbers {0, 3, 1, 2, 3}, then duplicated number is 3. Actually, this problem is very similar to previous one and you can apply the same trick of comparing actual sum of an array to expected sum of series to find out that duplicate. This is generally asked as follow-up question of previous problem.



3. How to check if array contains a number in Java? (solution)
Another interesting array problem, because array doesn't provide any built-in method to check if any number exists or not. This problem is essentially how to search an element in the array. There are two options sequential search or binary search. You should ask the interviewer about whether an array is sorted or not, if the array is sorted then you can use binary search to check if given number is present in an array or not. The complexity of binary search is O(logN). BTW, if interviewer says that array is not sorted then you can still sort and perform binary search otherwise you can use sequential search. Time complexity of sequential search in array is O(n).


4. How to find largest and smallest number in unsorted array? (solution)
This is a rather simple array interview question. You have given an unsorted integer array and you need to find the largest and smallest element in the array. Of course, you can sort the array and then pick the top and bottom element but that would cost you O(NLogN) because of sorting, getting element in array with index is O(1) operation.


5. How to find all pairs on integer array whose sum is equal to given number? (solution)
This is an intermediate level of array coding question, it's neither too easy nor too difficult. You have given an integer array and a number, you need to write a program to find all elements in the array whose sum is equal to the given number. Remember, the array may contain both positive and negative numbers, so your solution should consider that. Don't forget to write unit test though, even if the interviewer is not asked for it, that would separate you from a lot of developers. Unit testing is always expected from a professional developer.


6.   How to find repeated numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates? (solution)
This is actually the follow-up question of problem 2, how to find a duplicate number on integer array. In that case, an array contains only one duplicate but what if it contains multiple duplicates? Suppose, an array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-1 and there are 5 duplicates on it, how do you find it? You can use the approach, we have learned in similar String based problem of finding repeated characters in given String.


7. Write a program to remove duplicates from array in Java? (solution)
This is another follow-up question from problem 2 and 6. You have given an array which contains duplicates, could be one or more. You need to write a program to remove all duplicates from array in Java. For example if given array is {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} then your program should return an array which contains just {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. This array question is also comes at intermediate category because there is no way to delete an element from an array. If substituting with another value is not an option then you need to create another array to mimic deletion.


8. How to sort an array in place using QuickSort algorithm? (solution)
You will often see sorting problems on array related questions because sorting mostly happen on array data structure. You need to write a program to implement in place quick sort algorithm in Java. You can implement either recursive or iterative quicksort, it's your choice but you cannot use additional buffer, array or list, you must sort array in place.


9.   Write a program to find intersection of two sorted arrays in Java? (solution)
Another interesting array interview question, where you need to treat the array as Set. Your task is to write a function in your favorite language e.g. Java, Python, C or C++ to return the intersection of two sorted arrays. For example, if the two sorted arrays as input are {21, 34, 41, 22, 35} and {61, 34, 45, 21, 11}, it should return an intersection array with numbers {34, 21}, For the sake of this problem you can assume that numbers in each integer array are unique.


10. There is an array with every element repeated twice except one. Find that element? (solution)
This is an interesting array coding problem, just opposite of question related to finding duplicates in array. Here you need to find the unique number which is not repeated twice. For example if given array is {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5} then your program should return 3. Also, don't forget to write couple of unit test for your solution.

Java Array Interview Question Answer

11. How to find kth smallest element in unsorted array? (solution)
You are given an unsorted array of numbers and k, you need to find the kth smallest number in the array. For example if given array is {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} and k=2 then you need to find the 2nd smallest number in the array, which is 2. One way to solve this problem is to sort the array in ascending order then pick the k-1th element, that would be your kth smallest number in array because array index starts at zero, but can you do better? Once you are able to solve this array coding question, you can solve many similar questions easily e.g. our next question.


12. How to find kth largest element in unsorted array? (solution)
This problem is exactly same as previous question with only difference being finding kth largest element instead of kth smallest number. For example if given array is {10, 20, 30, 50, 40} and k = 3 then your program should return 30 because 30 is the 3rd largest number in array. You can also solve this problem by sorting the array in decreasing order and picking k-1th element. I often seen this array question on Java interviews with 2 to 3 years experienced guys.



13 How to find common elements in three sorted array? (solution)
Now we are coming on territory of tough array questions. Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

Examples:

input1 = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
input2 = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
input3 = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80


14. How find the first repeating element in an array of integers? (solution)
Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurrence is smallest.

Examples:

Input:  input [] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 5 [5 is the first element that repeats]


15. How to find first non-repeating element in array of integers? (solution)
This array interview question is exactly opposite of previous problem, In that you need to find first repeating element while in this you need to find first non-repeating element. I am sure you can use similar approach to solve this problem, just need to consider non repeating element though.


16. How to find top two numbers from an integer array? (solution)
This is another one of the easy array questions you will find on telephonic round of Interviews, but its also little bit tricky. You are asked to find top two numbers not just the top or highest numbers? Can you think of how you would do it without sorting? before looking at solution.


17. How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array? (solution)
This is another tough array question you will see on Amazon, Microsoft or Google. You have given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any subset of given set. What makes it more challenging is expected time complexity of O(n).

Examples:

Input: {1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 15};
Output: 2


18. How to rearrange array in alternating positive and negative number? (solution)
Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.
Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array. This is also a difficult array problem to solve and you need lot of practice to solve this kind of problems in real interviews, especially when you see it first time. If you have time constraint then always attempt these kind of questions once you are done with easier ones. 

Example:

Input: {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4}
Output: {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}

Input: {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8}
output: {-5, 5, -2, 2, -8, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0} 



19. How to find if there is a sub array with sum equal to zero? (solution)
There is whole set of array related questions which are based upon sub-array or only selective elements of array e.g. from some range, this is one of such problem. Here you are given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a sub-array with 0 sum.

Examples:

Input: {4, 2, -3, 1, 6}
Output: true 
There is a sub-array with zero sum from index 1 to 3.

20. How to remove duplicates from array in place? (solution)
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array A = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2]. 

When you see a questions which asked you do to sorting or task in place, it means you cannot use additional array or buffer, but using couple of variables is fine.


21. How to remove a given element from array in Java? (solution)
This is another array coding questions similar to previous one. Here you don't have to find and remove duplicates but a given number. In this problem you are given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length. The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length. 


22. How to merge sorted array? (solution)
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array. You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively. This is another intermediate array coding question, its not as simple as previous one but neither very difficult.


23. How to find sub array with maximum sum in an array of positive and negative number? (solution)
Another array coding question based upon sub-array. Here you have to find the contiguous sub-array within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 


24. How to find sub array with largest product in array of both positive and negative number? (solution) 
In this problem, your task is to write a program in Java or C++ to find the contiguous sub-array within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

For example, given the array [2,3,-2,4],
the contiguous subarray [2,3] has the largest product = 6. 


25. Write a program to find length of longest consecutive sequence in array of integers? (solution)
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Challenging part of this question is that your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. 


26. How to find minimum value in a rotated sorted array? (solution)
This is another advanced level array coding question and you should only attempt this one, once you have solved the easier ones. Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array. One follow-up question of this question is What if duplicates are allowed? Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?



27. Given an array of of size n and a number k, find all elements that appear more than n/k times? (solution)
Another tough array based coding questions from Interviews. You are given an array of size n, find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times. For example, if the input arrays is {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3} and k is 4, then the output should be [2, 3]. Note that size of array is 8 (or n = 8), so we need to find all elements that appear more than 2 (or 8/4) times. There are two elements that appear more than two times, 2 and 3.

1. Returns the largest sum of contiguous integers in the array
Example: if the input is (-10, 2, 3, -2, 0, 5, -15), the largest sum is 8

2. Return the sum two largest integers in an array

3. Given an array of integers write a program that will determine if any two numbers add up to a specified number N. Do this without using hash tables


28. How to reverse array in place in Java? (solution)
Now let's see one of the most frequently asked array interview question. You need to write a program which accepts an integer array and your program needs to reverse that array in place, which means you cannot use additional buffer or array, but one or two variables will be fine. Of course you cannot use any open source library or Java API method to directly solve this problem, you need to create your own logic. Here is one such logic to solve this problem :
Array Coding Interview Questions and Answers 


29. Difference between array and linked list data structure? (answer)
This is a theoretical questions from phone interviews. There are several differences between array and linked list e.g. array stores element in contiguous memory location while linked list stores at random places, this means linked list better utilizes the places. Consequently, its possible to have large linked list in limited memory environment compare to array of same size. Advantage of using array is random access it provides if you know the index, while in linked list you need to search an element by traversing which is O(n) operation.


30. How to check if array contains a duplicate number? (answer)
This may look a repeated question because we have already done similar question, but in this question, most from Java interviews, you need to write a contains() like method from Collections, which returns true or false if you pass an element and it is repeated or not.

Question 1 : Can you change size of array once created? [answer]
No, you cannot change the size of array once created. If you need dynamic array, consider using ArrayList class, which can resize itself.


Question 2 : Can you store String in an array of Integer in Java? compile time error or runtime exception? [answer]
This is a tricky question. Answer is both yes and no. You cannot store an String in an array of primitive int, it will result in compile time error as shown below, but if you create an array of Object and assign String[] to it and then try to store Integer object on it. Compiler won't be able to detect that and it will throw ArrayStoreExcpetion at runtime.
int[] primes = new int[10];
primes[0] = "a";  //compile time error
        
Object[] names = new String[3];
names[0] = new Integer(0); // ArrayStoreException at runtime


Question 3 : What is difference between ArrayIndexOutfOBounds and ArrayStoreException? [answer]
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException comes when your code tries to access an invalid index for a given array e.g. negative index or higher index than length - 1. While, ArrayStoreException comes when you have stored an element of type other than type of array, as shown in above example.


Question 4 : Can you use Generics with array? [answer]
No, you cannot use Generic with array, that's why sometime List is better choice over array in Java.


Question 5 : Is it legal to initialize an array int i[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; [answer]
Yes, its perfectly legal. You can create and initialize array in same line in Java.


Question 6 : Difference between a[] and []a in Java? [answer]
You can declare an array in Java by either prefixing or suffixing[] with variable. There is not much difference between them if you are not creating more than one variable in one line, but if you do then it creates different types of variables, as shown in following example :
int a[], b; // first is int array, second is just int variable
int[] c, d; // both c and d are integer array


Question 7 : What is two dimensional array? [answer]
An array of array in Java.  You can declare them like int[][] primes = new int[3][3] which is a matrix of 3x3.


Question 8 : Do you have three dimensional array in Java? [answer]
Yes, Java supports N dimensional array. Actually multi-dimensional array in Java is nothing but an array of array, for example, two dimensional array is just an array of one dimensional array.


Question 9 : How to iterate over array in Java? [answer]
You can either use classical for loop with index or advanced for loop introduced in Java 5 to iterate over an array in Java. If you need index to select some element or do something else, use for loop otherwise advanced for loop is better. It's less error prone as you don't need to deal with index.


Question 10 : How to search an array to check if an element exists there? [answer]
You can search an element inside array by using either linear search or binary search. Later is faster but you need to sort the array before performing binary search on it. Arrays class from java.util package provides binarySearch() method to search an element in array. Alternatively, you can also convert array to ArrayList and use its contains() method to find out if an element exists or not.


Question 11 : How to sort an array in Java? [answer]
You can sort an array in Java by using Arrays.sort() method. Arrays is a utility class which contains lots of static utility method to operate on arrays. This method is overloaded and you can optionally provide a Comparator implementation to sort array in custom order.


Question 12 : How to copy array in Java? [answer]
You can either manually copy elements of array by iterating over them, or you can use System.arrayCopy() method to copy elements form one array to other. This is a powerful method which provides fast copy and also allows you to copy entire or part of the array.


Question 13 : How to access elements of array in Java? [answer]
You can access elements of array using index in Java. It starts from 0, so first element is stored in location zero and last element has index length - 1. Trying to access an invalid index in Java e.g. negative index or index higher than size will result in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java.


Question 14 :  What is difference between an array and a linked list? [answer]
Some key difference between array and linked list data structure is, Array requires contiguous memory for its element but linked list elements can be scattered in memory.  Array is good for searching elements if you know the index, but adding and removing elements in array is expensive as compared to linked list.


Question 15 : Can you make array volatile in Java? [answer]
This is another tricky question in Java. Yes, you can make an array volatile in Java, but you only make the variable which is pointing to array volatile. If array is changed by replacing individual elements than happens before guarantee provided by volatile variables will not held.


Question 16 : Where does array stored in memory? [answer]
Array is created in heap space of JVM memory. Since array is object in Java, even if you create array locally inside a method or block, object is always allocated memory from heap.

Array concept interview questions and answers in Java


Array based Coding Interview Problems
Some array based coding interview questions, which require to build some logic to solve the problem. These questions are mainly asked to check your problem solving skill apart from your command on programming language. Actually, once you know the logic, you can solve these problem in any programming language e.g. C, C++, Python, Ruby or JavaScript.


Problem 1 : How to find missing number in array of 1 to 100 in Java? [solution]
You have given an array of integer which contains numbers from 1 to 100, but exactly one number is missing, how do you find that number? You can use additional data structure.


Problem 2 : How do you find all pair whose sum is equal to given number from integer array in Java? [solution]
You have given an array of int primitives and a number, you need to find all pairs in array whose sum is equal to given number e.g. if array is {1, 2, 3,  4, 5} and given sum is 6 then your program should return {2, 4} and {1, 5}


Problem 3 : How do you remove duplicates from array in Java? [solution]
You have given an array, which could be array of numbers or Strings or any objects. Some objects are added multiple times in array, you need to remove those elements from array. You don't know how many duplicates are there. You can use additional data structure and memory to solve this problem.


Problem 4 : How do you reverse an array in Java? [solution]
Given an array of String or integer, how do you reverse array, so that first element becomes last and last element becomes first e.g. if given array is {1, 2, 3, 4} then your program should reverse it as {4, 3, 2, 1}. You can use additional memory but reversing array in place will get bonus point.


Problem 5 : How to find duplicates numbers in array of integers in Java? [solution]
You have given an array {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4}, write a program to return duplicate elements e.g. 1 and 3 because they have appeared more than once in array.

1) What is ArrayStoreException in java? When you will get this exception?

ArrayStoreException is a run time exception which occurs when you try to store non-compatible element in an array object. The type of the elements must be compatible with the type of array object. For example, you can store only string elements in an array of strings. if you try to insert integer element in an array of strings, you will get ArrayStoreException at run time.

public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Object[] stringArray = new String[5];   //No compile time error : String[] is auto-upcasted to Object[]
        
        stringArray[1] = "JAVA";     
        
        stringArray[2] = 100;     //No compile time error, but this statement will throw java.lang.ArrayStoreException at run time
        
        //because we are inserting integer element into an array of strings
    }
}
2) Can you pass the negative number as an array size?

No. You can’t pass the negative integer as an array size. If you pass, there will be no compile time error but you will get NegativeArraySizeException at run time.

public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int[] array = new int[-5];     //No compile time error
        
        //but you will get java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException at run time
    }
}
3) Can you change the size of the array once you define it? OR Can you insert or delete the elements after creating an array?

No. You can’t change the size of the array once you define it. You can not insert or delete the elements after creating an array. Only you can do is change the value of the elements.

4) What is an anonymous array? Give example?

Anonymous array is an array without reference. For example,

public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //Creating anonymous arrays
 
        System.out.println(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.length);    //Output : 5
 
        System.out.println(new int[]{21, 14, 65, 24, 21}[1]);   //Output : 14
    }
}
5) What is the difference between int[] a and int a[] ?

READ :  Java Interview Questions On Inheritance
Both are the legal methods to declare the arrays in java.

6) There are two array objects of int type. one is containing 100 elements and another one is containing 10 elements. Can you assign array of 100 elements to an array of 10 elements?

Yes, you can assign array of 100 elements to an array of 10 elements provided they should be of same type. While assigning, compiler checks only type of the array not the size.

public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] a = new int[10];
        
        int[] b = new int[100];
        
        a = b;      //Compiler checks only type, not the size
    }
}
7) “int a[] = new int[3]{1, 2, 3}” – is it a legal way of defining the arrays in java?

No. You should not mention the size of the array when you are providing the array contents.

8) What are the differences between Array and ArrayList in java?

Array	ArrayList
Arrays are of fixed length.	ArrayList is of variable length.
You can’t change the size of the array once you create it.	Size of the ArrayList grows and shrinks as you add or remove the elements.
Array does not support generics.	ArrayList supports generics.
You can use arrays to store both primitive types as well as reference types.	You can store only reference types in an ArrayList.
9) What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

There are four methods available in java to copy an array.

1) Using for loop

2) Using Arrays.copyOf() method

3) Using System.arraycopy() method

4) Using clone() method

Click here to see these methods in detail.

10) What are jagged arrays in java? Give example?

Jagged arrays in java are the arrays containing arrays of different length. Jagged arrays are also multidimensional arrays. They are also called as ragged arrays.

READ :  10 Tricky Core Java Interview Coding Questions
Click here to see the jagged arrays in detail.

11) How do you check the equality of two arrays in java? OR How do you compare the two arrays in java?

You can use Arrays.equals() method to compare one dimensional arrays and to compare multidimensional arrays, use Arrays.deepEquals() method.

Click here to see more info on comparing two arrays in java.

12) What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a run time exception which occurs when your program tries to access invalid index of an array i.e negative index or index higher than the size of the array.

13) How do you sort the array elements?

You can sort the array elements using Arrays.sort() method. This method internally uses quick sort algorithm to sort the array elements.

import java.util.Arrays;
public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] a = new int[]{45, 12, 78, 34, 89, 21};
        
        Arrays.sort(a);
        
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
        
        //Output : [12, 21, 34, 45, 78, 89]
    }
}
14) How do you find the intersection of two arrays in java?

[Answer]

15) What are the different ways of declaring multidimensional arrays in java?

The following code snippet shows different ways of declaring 2D, 3D and 4D arrays.

//2D Arrays
int[][] twoDArray1;
        
int twoDArray2[][];
        
int[] twoDArray3[];
        
//3D Arrays
        
int[][][] threeDArray1;

int[] fourDArray3[][][];
        
int[][] fourDArray4[][];
        
int[][][] fourDArray5[];
16) While creating the multidimensional arrays, can you specify an array dimension after an empty dimension?

No. You can not specify an array dimension after an empty dimension while creating multidimensional arrays. It gives compile time error.

int[][][] a = new int[][5][];    //Compile time error
        
int[][][] b = new int[5][][5];   //Compile time error
        
int[][][] c = new int[][5][5];   //Compile time error
17) How do you search an array for a specific element?

READ :  How Are the Arrays stored in the memory?
You can search an array to check whether it contains the given element or not using Arrays.binarySearch() method. This method internally uses binary search algorithm to search for an element in an array.

18) What value does array elements get, if they are not initialized?

They get default values.

                    noOfUniqueElements--;
                     
                    //Decrementing j
                     
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }
         
        //Copying only unique elements of arrayWithDuplicates into arrayWithoutDuplicates
         
        int[] arrayWithoutDuplicates = Arrays.copyOf(arrayWithDuplicates, noOfUniqueElements);
         
        //Printing arrayWithoutDuplicates
         
        System.out.println("Array Without Duplicates : "+Arrays.toString(arrayWithoutDuplicates));
         
        System.out.println("==============================");

15) Write a java program to find the most frequent element in an array?

1) What do you mean by an Array?

Array is a set of similar data type.
Arrays objects store multiple variables with the same type.
It can hold primitive types and object references.
Arrays are always fixed
2) How to create an Array?

An Array is declared similar to how a variable is declared, but you need to add [] after the type.

Example: int [] intArray;

We can declare Java array as a field, static field, a local variable, or parameter, like any other variable. An array is a collection of variables of that type. Here are a few more Java array declaration examples:

String [] stringArray;

MyClass [] myClassArray;

Same is the case for other programming languages.

3) Advantages and disadvantages of Array?

Advantages:

We can put in place other data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. in Array.
Arrays can sort multiple elements at a time.
We can access an element of Array by using an index.
Disadvantages:

We have to declare Size of an array in advance. However, we may not know what size we need at the time of array declaration.
The array is static structure. It means array size is always fixed, so we cannot increase or decrease memory allocation.
4) Can we change the size of an array at run time?

No we cannot change the array size. Though there are similar data types available which allow a change in size.

5) Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array? 
No we cannot declare an array without assigning size.

If we declare an array without size, it will throw compile time error

Example: marks = new int []; //COMPILER ERROR



6) What is the default value of Array?

Any new Array is always initialized with a default value as follows

For byte, short, int, long – default value is zero (0).
For float, double – default value is 0.0.
For Boolean – default value is false.
For object – default value is null.
7) How to print element of Array?

Here is code to print element of the array.


int schoolmarks [] = {25, 30, 50, 10, 5 };
System.out.println (Arrays.toString (schoolmarks));
1
2
3
int schoolmarks [] = {25, 30, 50, 10, 5 };
 
System.out.println (Arrays.toString (schoolmarks));
Output is: [25, 30, 50, 10, 5]

8) How to compare Two Arrays?

If 2 arrays are of the sam size & data type then comparison can be done using “Arrays.equal ()”


int [] num1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] num2 = { 4, 5, 6 };
System.out.println (Arrays. Equals (num1, num2)); //false
Int [] num3 = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println (Arrays.equals (num1, num3)); //true
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
int [] num1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
 
int[] num2 = { 4, 5, 6 };
 
System.out.println (Arrays. Equals (num1, num2)); //false
 
Int [] num3 = {1, 2, 3};
 
System.out.println (Arrays.equals (num1, num3)); //true
9) How to sort an Array?

It is possible using the built static method that is Arrays. sort ().


Int Marks [] = {12, 5, 7, 9};
Arrays.sort(Marks);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Marks));//[5, 7, 9, 12]
1
2
3
4
5
Int Marks [] = {12, 5, 7, 9};
 
Arrays.sort(Marks);
 
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Marks));//[5, 7, 9, 12]
10) Can we declare array size as a negative number?

No. We cannot declare the negative integer as an array size.

If we declare, there will be no compile-time error.

However, we will get NegativeArraySizeException at run time.

11) When will we get ArrayStoreException?

It is a runtime exception. For example, we can store only string elements in a String Array. If anybody tries to insert integer element in this String Array, then we will get ArrayStoreException at run time.

12) Can we add or delete an element after assigning an array?

No it is not possible.

13) What is the meaning of anonymous array? Explain with an example?

Anonymous array means array without any reference.

Example:-


//Creating anonymous arrays
System.out.println(new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.length); //Output : 5
System.out.println(new int[]{31, 94, 75, 64, 41}[1]); //Output : 94 }}
1
2
3
4
5
//Creating anonymous arrays
 
System.out.println(new int[]{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.length); //Output : 5
 
System.out.println(new int[]{31, 94, 75, 64, 41}[1]); //Output : 94 }}
14) Is there any difference between int[] a and int a[]?

No difference both are the legal statement.

15) There are 2 int type array data type. One is containing 50 elements, and another one is containing 30 elements. Can we assign the array of 50 elements to an array of 30 elements?

Yes we can assign provided they should the same type. The compiler will check the only type of the array, not the size.


int[] ab = new int[30];
int[] cd = new int[50];
a = b; //Compiler checks only type, not the size
1
2
3
4
5
int[] ab = new int[30];
 
int[] cd = new int[50];
 
a = b; //Compiler checks only type, not the size
16) int a[] = new int[3]{1, 2, 3} – is it a right way to declare arrays in java?

No. We should not mention the size of the array when we are providing the array elements.

17) How to copy an array into another array?

Below four tricks are available in java to copy an array.

Using “For loop”
Using “Arrays.copyOf()” method
Using “System.arraycopy()” method
Using “clone()” method
18) What are “jagged” arrays in java?

Jagged Arrays are Arrays are containing arrays of different length. Jagged arrays are also known as multidimensional arrays.

19) When ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs?

It is a run time exception.

It will occur when the program tries to access invalid index of an array. Index higher than the size of the array or negative index.
20) Can you explain different steps of declaring multidimensional arrays in Java?


//2D Arrays
int[][] twoArray1;
int twoArray2[][];
int[] twoArray3[];
//3D Arrays
int[][][] threeArray1;
int threeArray2[][][];
int[] threeArray3[][];
int[][] threeArray4[];

//4D Arrays
 
int[][][][] fourArray1;
 
int fourArray2[][][][];
 
int[] fourArray3[][][];
 
int[][] fourArray4[][];
 
int[][][] fourArray5[];
21) How do we search a specific element in an array?

We can use Arrays.binarySearch() method. This method uses binary search algorithm.

22) If you do not initialize an array what will happen?

Array will have default value.

23) How do we find duplicate elements in an array?

Using Brute Force Method:

In this method, we compare each element of an array with other elements.

If any two elements found equal or same, we declare them as duplicates. Please find below code for the same


public class DuplicatesInArray {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String[] strArray1 = {"abc1", "def1", "mno1", "xyz1", "pqr1", "xyz1", "def1"};
for (int i = 0; i < strArray1.length-1; i++) {
for (int j = i+1; j < strArray1.length; j++) {
if( (strArray1[i].equals(strArray1[j])) && (i != j) ) {
System.out.println("Duplicates : "+strArray1[j]);
}}}} }

String[] strArray1 = {"abc1", "def1", "mno1", "xyz1", "pqr1", "xyz1", "def1"};
 
for (int i = 0; i < strArray1.length-1; i++) {
 
for (int j = i+1; j < strArray1.length; j++) {
 
if( (strArray1[i].equals(strArray1[j])) && (i != j) ) {
 
System.out.println("Duplicates : "+strArray1[j]);
 
}}}} }
Output: Duplicate Element is : def1

Duplicate Element is: xyz1

24) Can we use Generics with the array?

No, we cannot use Generic with an array.

25) How to iterate an array in java?

1) Using normal for loop


public class MainClass1
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int[] a1 = new int[]{45, 12, 78, 34, 89, 21};
//Iterating over an array using normal for loop
for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++)
{
System.out.println(a1[i]);
}}}

{
 
int[] a1 = new int[]{45, 12, 78, 34, 89, 21};
 
//Iterating over an array using normal for loop
 
for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++)
 
{
 
System.out.println(a1[i]);
 
}}}
2) Using extended new for loop


public class MainClass1
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int[] a2 = new int[]{45, 12, 78, 34, 89, 21};
//Iterating over an array using extended for loop
for (int i: a2){
System.out.println(i);
}}}

//Iterating over an array using extended for loop
 
for (int i: a2){
 
System.out.println(i);
 
}}}
26) Where is the memory allocated for arrays in Java?

In Java, memory for arrays is always allocated on the heap as arrays in Java are objects.

27) Can you tell me the class name of an array in Java?

Array is an object. To retirve class name we can use getClass().getName() method on the object.

28) “int a[] = new int[3]{1, 2, 3}” – This a legal way of defining the arrays?

No. We should not declare the size of the array when we are providing the array elements.

29) What is the two-dimensional array?

An array of an array in Java. We can declare them like
int[][] p = new int[3][3] which is a matrix of 3×3.

30) Do we have 3-dimensional arrays in Java?

Yes, Java supports N-dimensional array.

Multi-dimensional array in Java is nothing but an array of array,

Example: 2-dimensional array is an array of 1-dimensional array.

31) Can we make array volatile in Java?

Yes, we can make an array volatile in Java, but we only make the variable which is pointing to array volatile.

32) What will be the output of below code?

int myArr[] = new int [7];

System.out.print(myArr);

Ans: Output will be Garbage value.

myArr is an array variable, myArr is pointing to an array if it is integers.

Printing myArr will print garbage value. It is not same as printing myArr[0].

33) What is the step to access elements of an array in Java?

We can access using “index”.

Index starts from Zero(0), so the first element is stored in location zero and the last element will be Array.length – 1.

Example:-String strArr[] = new String []{“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”};

strArr[0] means “A” and strArr[2] means “C”.

34) Can you tell me the differences between Array and ArrayList?

Array	ArrayList
The array is static with a fixed size which cannot be changed once delared.	ArrayList is not static but dynamic in size. As elements added to an ArrayList, its capacity or size grows automaticically.
It contains both primitive data types and objects of a class.	ArrayList does not contain the primitive data types but contains object entries.
Array does not have Generics feature.	ArayList has Generics feature.
35) We know that Arrays are objects so why cannot we write strArray.length()?

Arrays are object references like classes in Java. We can use the methods of Object like toString () and another one hashCode () against Array. Length is a data item of an array and so it is not a method. That’s why we are using strArray.length.

36) How to find the missing element in integer array of 1 to 7?

Solutions to solve this problem is to calculate sum of all numbers in the array

and compare with an expected sum, the difference would be the missing number.

int ar [] = new int[]{1,2,3,5,6,7};

Get the sum of numbers
total = n*(n+1)/2
Subtract all the numbers from sum and
you will get the missing number.
According to below logic sumOfNnumberss is 7*(7+1)/2=28
sumOfElements = 1+2+3+5+6+7=24

missing element is = 28-24=4


int n = ar.length+1;
int total = n*(n+1)/2;
for(int i =0;i<ar.length;i++){
total -=ar[i];}
System.out.println(total);

int n = ar.length+1;
 
int total = n*(n+1)/2;
 
for(int i =0;i<ar.length;i++){
 
total -=ar[i];}
 
System.out.println(total);
37) How to find the duplicate in an array?


String str = "HI RAHUL I AM FINE RAHUL"; // String with a duplicate word.
String[] words = str.split(" "); // Splitting and converting to Array .
for(int i = 0; i < words.length; i++){ //iterating array inside for loop
for(int j = i+1; j < words.length; j++){ //iterating same array inside another for loop
if (words[i].equals(words[j])){ // Using equal method i am verifying which word is repeating . System.out.println( words[i]); // here it will print duplicate .

for(int j = i+1; j < words.length; j++){ //iterating same array inside another for loop
 
if (words[i].equals(words[j])){ // Using equal method i am verifying which word is repeating . System.out.println( words[i]); // here it will print duplicate .
 
}}}
38) How to check array contains value or not?

Here is a String[] with values

public static final String[] myNames = new String[] {“B”,”A”,”K”,”C”};

If myNames contains that value then it will return true otherwise false.

Here is two methods isExists() and contains()

both the methods return true if the value is available otherwise false.

First Method

It is converting an array to ArrayList.

After that it will test if an array contains any value then it will return true otherwise false.


public static <T> boolean isExists(final T[] array, final T object) {
return Arrays.asList(array).contains(object); }
1
2
3
public static <T> boolean isExists(final T[] array, final T object) {
 
return Arrays.asList(array).contains(object); }
Second Method

This method loop through an array and use equal() method to search element.

This actually performs a linear search over an array in Java. It will return true if an array has provided value.


public static <T> boolean contains(final T[] array, final T v) {
for (final T e : array) { if (e == v || v != null && v.equals(e)) {
return true;
} }
return false;
} }

public static <T> boolean contains(final T[] array, final T v) {
 
for (final T e : array) { if (e == v || v != null && v.equals(e)) {
 
return true;
 
} }
 
return false;
 
} }
39) How to get largest and smallest number in an array?

Ans: Logic of this problem:

We use two variables to store largest and smallest number.
First, we initialize largest with Integer.MIN_VALUE and
Next, we initialize smallest with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
In each iteration of the for loop, we will compare present number with largest and smallest number, and we will update
If a number is larger than largest, then it cannot be smaller than smallest. That means no need to check if the first condition is true,
We will use the if-else code block, where else part will only execute if the first condition is false means not true.

import java.util.Arrays;
public class MaximumMinimumArrayExample{
public static void largestAndSmallest(int[] numbers) {

40) How to do the intersection of two sorted arrays?

Ans: Logic: print the element if the element is present or available in both the arrays.

Use two index variables i and j, after that initial the values i = 0, j = 0
If arr01 [i] is smaller than arr02 [j] then increment i.
If arr01 [i] is greater than arr02 [j] then increment j.
If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j.

public static void getIntersection(int arr01[], int arr02[], int m, int n){
int i = 0, j = 0;
while (i < m && j < n){
if (arr01[i] < arr02[j])
i++;
else if (arr02[j] < arr01[i])
j++;
else{
System.out.print(arr02[j++]+" ");
i++;
}
}
}
public static void main(String args[]){
int arr01[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6};
int arr02[] = {2, 3, 5, 7};
int m = arr01.length;
int n = arr02.length;
getIntersection(arr01, arr02, m, n);

41) How to get top two numbers from an array?

Ans: Logic is:

We will assign first variable max01 with Integer.MIN_VALUE
Moreover, second variable max02 with same as max01 that is Integer.MIN_VALUE.

We will iterate this array and compare each number with max01 and max02,
If current number is greater than max1 then assign max01 = number and max02 = max1.
Else if it is only greater than max02 then we will only update max02 with the current number.
At the end of an iteration, max01 and max02 points to top two numbers from given array.

import java.util.Arrays;
public class TopTwoMaximumNumbers{
public static void main(String args[]) {
topTwoNumbers(new int[]{20, 34, 21, 87, 92, Integer.MAX_VALUE});
topTwoNumbers(new int[]{0, Integer.MIN_VALUE, -2});
topTwoNumbers(new int[]{Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE});
topTwoNumbers(new int[]{1, 1, 0}); }
public static void topTwoNumbers(int[] numbers) {
int max01 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
int max02 = Integer.MIN_VALUE; for (int number : numbers) {
if (number > max01) { max02 = max01; max01 = number; }
else if (number > max02) { max02 = number; } }
System.out.println("First largest number is : " + max01);
System.out.println("Second largest number is : " + max02); } }

42) How to cut or remove an element from the array?

Ans: Logic is: We can remove or cut an element using Apache Commons ArrayUtils based on an index.

ArrayUtils has several overloaded remove() method.


import java.util.Arrays;
import org.apache.commons.lang.ArrayUtils;
public class RemoveFromArray{
public static void main(String args[]) {
//let's create an array for demonstration purpose
int[] testArr = new int[] { 10, 102, 13, 14, 105};
System.out.println("Array size : " + testArr.length );
System.out.println("Find Contents : " + Arrays.toString(testArr));
//let's remove or delete an element from Array using Apache Commons ArrayUtils
testArr = ArrayUtils.remove(testArr, 2); //removing element at index 2
//Size of array must be 1 less than original array after deleting an element
System.out.println("Size of array after removing : " + testArr.length);
System.out.println("Content of Array : "+ Arrays.toString(testArr));
} }

System.out.println("Array size : " + testArr.length );
 
System.out.println("Find Contents : " + Arrays.toString(testArr));
 
//let's remove or delete an element from Array using Apache Commons ArrayUtils
 
testArr = ArrayUtils.remove(testArr, 2); //removing element at index 2
 
//Size of array must be 1 less than original array after deleting an element
 
System.out.println("Size of array after removing : " + testArr.length);
 
System.out.println("Content of Array : "+ Arrays.toString(testArr));
 
} }
43) What is the logic to reverse the array?

Ans: Logic: print the element in reverse order.

Declare a String Array String[] s = new String[]{“My”,”Leg”,”is”,”cut”};
Iterate it using for loop get all elements in reverse order means end point to start point.

public static void main(String[] args)
{String[] s = new String[]{"My","Leg","is","cut"};
for(int i=s.length-1; i>=0; i--){
System.out.println("reverse "+s[i]);}}

44) How do you find the second largest element in an array of integers?

Ans: Logic is:

Iterate the given array using for loop.
(first if condition arr[i] > largest):
If current array value is greater than largest value then
Move the largest value to secondLargest and make current value as largest
(second if condition arr[i] > secondLargest )
If the current value is smaller than largest and
greater than secondLargest then the current value becomes


public static void main(String[] args) {
int myArr[] = { 14, 46, 47, 86, 92, 52, 48, 36, 66, 85 };
int largest = myArr[0];
int secondLargest = myArr[0];
System.out.println("The given array is:" );
for (int i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
System.out.print(myArr[i]+"\t");
}
for (int i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
if (myArr[i] > largest) {
secondLargest = largest;
largest = myArr[i];
} else if (myArr[i] > secondLargest) {secondLargest = myArr[i];
}}
System.out.println("\nSecond largest number is:" + secondLargest);

System.out.println("The given array is:" );
 
for (int i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
 
System.out.print(myArr[i]+"\t");
 
}
 
for (int i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
 
if (myArr[i] > largest) {
 
secondLargest = largest;
 
largest = myArr[i];
 
} else if (myArr[i] > secondLargest) {secondLargest = myArr[i];
 
}}
 
System.out.println("\nSecond largest number is:" + secondLargest);
 
}
45) Write a program to sum values of given array.

Ans: Logic is:

Declare and assign int variable that is sum =0.
Iterate the given array using for loop.
Add all the array element and keep in this variable that is the sum.

Public static void main(String[] args) {
int my_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int sum = 0;
for (int i: my_array)
sum += i;
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);

for (int i: my_array)
 
sum += i;
 
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
 
}
46) How do you separate zeros from non-zeros in an array?

Ans: Logic is:

Initializing counter to 0
Traversing inputArray from left to right
If inputArray[i] is non-zero
Assigning inputArray[i] to inputArray[counter]
Incrementing the counter by 1
Assigning zero to remaining elements

Public class SeparateZerosFromNonZeros
{ static void moveZerosToEnd(int inputArray[]) { int counter = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++)
{
if(inputArray[i] != 0) {
inputArray[counter] = inputArray[i];
counter++;
} }
while (counter < inputArray.length) {
inputArray[counter] = 0;
counter++; }
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(inputArray));
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
moveZerosToEnd(new int[] {12, 0, 7, 0, 8, 0, 3});
moveZerosToEnd(new int[] {1, -5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1});

47) Write a program to insert an element and in the specific position in the array?

Ans: Logic is:

Insert an element in 3rd position of the array (index->2, value->5)
Iterate the given array in reverse order using for loop.
Now insert given position and value after for loop.

Public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] my_array = {25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49};
int Index_position = 2;
int newValue = 5;
System.out.println("Original Array : "+Arrays.toString(my_array));
for(int i=my_array.length-1; i > Index_position; i--){
my_array[i] = my_array[i-1];
}my_array[Index_position] = newValue;

System.out.println("Original Array : "+Arrays.toString(my_array));
 
for(int i=my_array.length-1; i > Index_position; i--){
 
my_array[i] = my_array[i-1];
}my_array[Index_position] = newValue;
 
System.out.println("New Array: "+Arrays.toString(my_array));
 
}
48) How to get the index of an array element?

Ans: Logic is:

In each step, it checks the input key value with the value of the middle element of an array.
If the keys match then it will return the position. In another case, if the key is less than the middle element’s key,
Then it will repeat the while loop. If the remaining array searched and it reduced to zero it will return -1 means not found

public static int findIndex (int[] my_array, int t) {
int startPoint = 0;
int endPoint = my_array.length - 1;
while (startPoint <= endPoint) {
int mid = (startPoint + end) / 2;
if (key == my_array[mid]) {
return mid;
}
if (key < my_array[mid]) {
endPoint = mid - 1;
} else {
startPoint = mid + 1;
}
}
return -1;
}
Public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16};
System.out.println("Key 14's position: "findIndex(arr, 14));
int[] arr1 = {6,34,78,123,432,900};
System.out.println("Key 432's position: "+findIndex(arr1, 432));

49 Can we extend an array after initialization?

Ans: Logic is: We can extend an array after initialization by adding a new array.

Please find below example.


Public static void main(String[] args) {
String [] names = new String[] { "A", "B", "C" };
String [] extended = new String[5];
extended [3] = "D";
extended [4] = "E";
System.arraycopy(names, 0, extended, 0, names.length);
//here we are extending with new array extended[3] and extended[4].
for (String str: extended){
System.out.println(str);
}
