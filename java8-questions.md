#### Q. Can you declare an interface method static?
Java 8 interface changes include static methods and default methods in interfaces. Prior to Java 8, we could have only method declarations in the interfaces. But from Java 8, we can have default methods and static methods in the interfaces.

#### Q. What is a lambda? What is the structure and features of using a lambda expression?
A lambda is a set of instructions that can be separated into a separate variable and then repeatedly called in various places of the program.

The basis of the lambda expression is the _lambda operator_ , which represents the arrow `->`. This operator divides the lambda expression into two parts: the left side contains a list of expression parameters, and the right actually represents the body of the lambda expression, where all actions are performed.

The lambda expression is not executed by itself, but forms the implementation of the method defined in the functional interface. It is important that the functional interface should contain only one single method without implementation.
```java
interface  Operationable {
     int  calculate ( int  x , int  y );
}

public  static  void main ( String [] args) {
    Operationable operation = (x, y) - > x + y;     
    int result = operation.calculate ( 10 , 20 );
    System.out.println (result); // 30 
}
```
In fact, lambda expressions are in some way a shorthand form of internal anonymous classes that were previously used in Java.

* _Deferred execution lambda expressions_ - it is defined once in one place of the program, it is called if necessary, any number of times and in any place of the program.

* _The parameters of the lambda expression_ must correspond in type to the parameters of the functional interface method:
```javascript
operation = ( int x, int y) - > x + y;
// When writing the lambda expression itself, the parameter type is allowed not to be specified: 
(x, y) - > x + y;
// If the method does not accept any parameters, then empty brackets are written, for example: 
() - >  30  +  20 ;
// If the method accepts only one parameter, then the brackets can be omitted: 
n - > n * n;
```
* Trailing lambda expressions are not required to return any value.
```java
interface  Printable {
     void  print( String  s );
}
 
public  static  void main ( String [] args) {
    Printable printer = s - >  System.out.println(s);
    printer.print("Hello, world");
}

// _ Block lambda - expressions_ are surrounded by curly braces . The modular lambda - expressions can be used inside nested blocks, loops, `design the if ` ` switch statement ', create variables, and so on . d . If you block a lambda - expression must return a value, it explicitly applies `statement return statement ' :


Operationable operation = ( int x, int y) - > {       
    if (y ==  0 ) {
        return  0 ;
    }
    else {
        return x / y;
    }
};
```
* Passing a lambda expression as a method parameter
```java
interface  Condition {
     boolean  isAppropriate ( int  n );
}

private  static  int sum ( int [] numbers, Condition condition) {
     int result =  0 ;
    for ( int i : numbers) {
         if (condition.isAppropriate(i)) {
            result + = i;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

public  static  void main ( String [] args) {
     System.out.println(sum ( new  int [] { 0 , 1 , 0 , 3 , 0 , 5 , 0 , 7 , 0 , 9 }, (n) - > n ! =  0 ));
} 
```
#### Q. What variables do lambda expressions have access to?
Access to external scope variables from a lambda expression is very similar to access from anonymous objects. 

* immutable ( effectively final - not necessarily marked as final) local variables;
* class fields
* static variables.

The default methods of the implemented functional interface are not allowed to be accessed inside the lambda expression.

#### Q. How to sort a list of strings using a lambda expression?
```java
public  static  List < String > sort ( List < String > list) {
    Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> a.compareTo(b));
    return list;
}
```
#### Q. What is a method reference?
If the method existing in the class already does everything that is necessary, then you can use the method reference mechanism (method reference) to directly pass this method. The result will be exactly the same as in the case of defining a lambda expression that calls this method.
```java
private  interface  Measurable {
    public  int  length ( String  string );
}

public  static  void main ( String [] args) {
    Measurable a =  String::length;
    System.out.println(a.length("abc"));
}
```
Method references are potentially more efficient than using lambda expressions. In addition, they provide the compiler with better information about the type, and if you can choose between using a reference to an existing method and using a lambda expression, you should always use a method reference.

#### Q. What types of method references do you know?
* on the static method;
* per instance method;
* to the constructor.

#### Q. Explain the expression `System.out::println`
The specified expression illustrates passing a reference to a static method of a `println()`class `System.out`.

#### Q. What is a Functional Interface?
A **functional interface** is an interface that defines only one abstract method.

To accurately determine the interface as functional, an annotation has been added `@FunctionalInterface` that works on the principle of `@Override`. It will designate a plan and will not allow to define the second abstract method in the interface.

An interface can include as many `default` methods as you like while remaining functional, because `default` methods are not abstract.

#### Q. What is StringJoiner?
The class is StringJoinerused to create a sequence of strings separated by a separator with the ability to append a prefix and suffix to the resulting string:
```java
StringJoiner joiner =  new  StringJoiner ( " . " , " Prefix- " , " -suffix " );
for ( String s :  " Hello the brave world " . split ( "  " )) {
    , joiner, . add (s);
}
System.out.println(joiner); // prefix-Hello.the.brave.world-suffix
```
#### Q. What are `default`interface methods?
Java 8 allows you to add non-abstract method implementations to an interface using the keyword default:
```java
interface  Example {
    int  process ( int  a );
    default void  show () {
        System.out.println("default show ()");
    }
}
```
* If a class implements an interface, it can, but does not have to, implement the default methods already implemented in the * interface. The class inherits the default implementation.
* If a class implements several interfaces that have the same default method, then the class must implement the method with the same signature on its own. The situation is similar if one interface has a default method, and in the other the same method is abstract - no class default implementation is inherited.
* The default method cannot override the class method `java.lang.Object`.
* They help implement interfaces without fear of disrupting other classes.
* Avoid creating utility classes, since all the necessary methods can be represented in the interfaces themselves.
* They give classes the freedom to choose the method to be redefined.
* One of the main reasons for introducing default methods is the ability of collections in Java 8 to use lambda expressions.

#### Q. How to call `default` interface method in a class that implements this interface?
Using the keyword superalong with the interface name:
```java
interface  Paper {
    default void  show () {
        System.out.println(" default show ()");
    }
}

class  License  implements  Paper {
     public  void  show () {
        Paper.super.show();
    }
}
```
#### Q. What is `static` interface method?
Static interface methods are similar to default methods, except that there is no way to override them in classes that implement the interface.

* Static methods in the interface are part of the interface without the ability to use them for objects of the implementation class
* Class methods `java.lang.Object`cannot be overridden as static
* Static methods in the interface are used to provide helper methods, for example, checking for null, sorting collections, etc.

#### Q. How to call `static` interface method?
Using the interface name:
```java
interface  Paper {
     static  void  show () {
         System.out.println( " static show () " );
    }
}

class  License {
     public  void  showPaper () {
         Paper.show ();
    }
}
```
#### Q. What is Optional
An optional value `Optional`is a container for an object that may or may not contain a value `null`. Such a wrapper is a convenient means of prevention `NullPointerException`, as has some higher-order functions, eliminating the need for repeating `if null/notNullchecks`:
```java
Optional < String > optional =  Optional . of ( " hello " );

optional.isPresent(); // true 
optional.ifPresent(s ->  System.out.println(s . length ())); // 5 
optional.get(); // "hello" 
optional.orElse( " ops ... " ); // "hello"
```
#### Q. What is Stream?
An interface `java.util.Stream` is a sequence of elements on which various operations can be performed.

Operations on streams can be either intermediate (intermediate) or final (terminal) . Final operations return a result of a certain type, and intermediate operations return the same stream. Thus, you can build chains of several operations on the same stream.

A stream can have any number of calls to intermediate operations and the last call to the final operation. At the same time, all intermediate operations are performed lazily and until the final operation is called, no actions actually happen (similar to creating an object `Thread`or `Runnable`, without a call `start()`).

Streams are created based on sources of some, for example, classes from `java.util.Collection`.

Associative arrays (maps), for example `HashMap`, are not supported.

Operations on streams can be performed both sequentially and in parallel.

Streams cannot be reused. As soon as some final operation has been called, the flow is closed.

In addition to the universal object, there are special types of streams to work with primitive data types `int`, `long`and `double`: `IntStream`, `LongStream`and `DoubleStream`. These primitive streams work just like regular object streams, but with the following differences:

* use specialized lambda expressions, for example, `IntFunction`or `IntPredicate`instead of `Function`and `Predicate`;
* support additional end operations `sum()`, `average()`, `mapToObj()`.

#### Q. What are the ways to create a stream?
* Using collection:
```java
Stream < String > fromCollection =  Arrays.asList ( " x " , " y " , " z " ).stream ();
```
* Using  set of values:
```java
Stream < String > fromValues =  Stream.of( " x " , " y " , " z " );
```
* Using Array
```java
Stream < String > fromArray =  Arrays.stream( new  String [] { " x " , " y " , " z " });
```
* Using file (each line in the file will be a separate element in the stream):
```java
Stream < String > fromFile =  Files.lines( Paths.get(" input.txt "));
```
* From the line:
```java
IntStream fromString =  " 0123456789 " . chars ();
```
* With the help of `Stream.builder()`:
```java
Stream < String > fromBuilder =  Stream.builder().add (" z ").add(" y ").add(" z ").build ();
```
* Using `Stream.iterate()(infinite)`:
```java
Stream < Integer > fromIterate =  Stream.iterate ( 1 , n - > n +  1 );
```
* Using `Stream.generate()(infinite)`:
```java
Stream < String > fromGenerate =  Stream.generate(() ->  " 0 " );
```
#### Q. What is the difference between `Collection` and `Stream`?
Collections allow you to work with elements separately, while streams do not allow this, but instead provides the ability to perform functions on data as one.

#### Q. What is the method `collect()`for streams for?
A method `collect()`is the final operation that is used to represent the result as a collection or some other data structure.

`collect()`accepts an input that contains four stages: 

* **supplier** â€” initialization of the battery,
* **accumulator** â€” processing of each element,
* **combiner** â€” connection of two accumulators in parallel execution,
* **[finisher]** â€”a non-mandatory method of the last processing of the accumulator. 

In Java 8, the class `Collectors` implements several common collectors:  

* `toList()`, `toCollection()`, `toSet()`- present stream in the form of a list, collection or set;
* `toConcurrentMap()`, `toMap()`- allow you to convert the stream to `Map`;
* `averagingInt()`, `averagingDouble()`, `averagingLong()`- return the average value;
* `summingInt()`, `summingDouble()`, `summingLong()`- returns the sum;
* `summarizingInt()`, `summarizingDouble()`, `summarizingLong()`- return SummaryStatisticswith different values of the aggregate;
* `partitioningBy()`- divides the collection into two parts according to the condition and returns them as `Map<Boolean, List>`;
* `groupingBy()`- divides the collection into several parts and returns `Map<N, List<T>>`;
* `mapping()`- Additional value conversions for complex Collectors.

There is also the possibility of creating your own collector through `Collector.of()`:
```java
Collector < String , a List < String > , a List < String > > toList =  Collector.of (
    ArrayList :: new ,
    List :: add,
    (l1, l2) -> {l1 . addAll (l2); return l1; }
);
```
#### Q. Why do streams use `forEach()`and `forEachOrdered()` methods?
* `forEach()` applies a function to each stream object; ordering in parallel execution is not guaranteed;
* `forEachOrdered()` applies a function to each stream object while maintaining the order of the elements.

#### Q. What are the methods in Stream `map()`, `mapToInt()`, `mapToDouble()` and `mapToLong()`?
The method `map()`is an intermediate operation, which transforms each element of the stream in a specified way.

`mapToInt()`, `mapToDouble()`, `mapToLong()`- analogues `map()`, returns the corresponding numerical stream (ie the stream of numerical primitives):
```java
Stream 
    .of ( " 12 " , " 22 " , " 4 " , " 444 " , " 123 " )
    .mapToInt ( Integer :: parseInt)
    .toArray (); // [12, 22, 4, 444, 123]
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of the method `filter()`in streams?
The method `filter()` is an intermediate operation receiving a predicate that filters all elements, returning only those that match the condition.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `Function<T,R>`, `DoubleFunction<R>`, `IntFunction<R>` and `LongFunction<R>`?
`Function<T, R>`- the interface with which a function is implemented that receives an instance of the class `T` and returns an instance of the class at the output `R`.

Default methods can be used to build call chains ( `compose`, `andThen`).
```java
Function < String , Integer > toInteger =  Integer :: valueOf;
Function < String , String > backToString = toInteger.andThen ( String :: valueOf);
backToString.apply("123");     // "123"
```
* `DoubleFunction<R>`- a function that receives input `Double` and returns an instance of the class at the output `R`;
* `IntFunction<R>`- a function that receives input `Integer`and returns an instance of the class at the output `R`;
* `LongFunction<R>`- a function that receives input `Long`and returns an instance of the class at the output `R`.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `UnaryOperator<T>`, `DoubleUnaryOperator`, `IntUnaryOperator`and `LongUnaryOperator`?
`UnaryOperator<T>`(**unary operator**) takes an object of type as a parameter `T`, performs operations on them and returns the result of operations in the form of an object of type `T`:
```java
UnaryOperator < Integer > operator = x - > x * x;
System.out.println(operator.apply ( 5 )); // 25
```
* `DoubleUnaryOperator`- unary operator receiving input `Double`;
* `IntUnaryOperator`- unary operator receiving input `Integer`;
* `LongUnaryOperator`- unary operator receiving input `Long`.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `BinaryOperator<T>`, `DoubleBinaryOperator`, `IntBinaryOperator`and `LongBinaryOperator`?
`BinaryOperator<T>`(**binary operator**) - an interface through which a function is implemented that receives two instances of the class `T`and returns an instance of the class at the output `T`.
```java
BinaryOperator < Integer > operator = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(operator.apply ( 1 , 2 )); // 3
```
* `DoubleBinaryOperator`- binary operator receiving input Double;
* `IntBinaryOperator`- binary operator receiving input Integer;
* `LongBinaryOperator`- binary operator receiving input Long.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `Predicate<T>`, `DoublePredicate`, `IntPredicateand` `LongPredicate`?
`Predicate<T>`(**predicate**) - the interface with which a function is implemented that receives an instance of the class as input `T`and returns the type value at the output `boolean`.

The interface contains a variety of methods by default, allow to build complex conditions ( `and`, `or`, `negate`).
```java
Predicate < String > predicate = (s) -> s.length () >  0 ;
predicate.test("foo"); // true 
predicate.negate().test("foo"); // false
```
* `DoublePredicate`- predicate receiving input `Double`;
* `IntPredicate`- predicate receiving input `Integer`;
* `LongPredicate`- predicate receiving input `Long`.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `Consumer<T>`, `DoubleConsumer`, `IntConsumer`and `LongConsumer`?
`Consumer<T>`(**consumer**) - the interface through which a function is implemented that receives an instance of the class as an input `T`, performs some action with it, and returns nothing.
```java
Consumer<String> hello = (name) ->  System.out.println( " Hello, "  + name);
hello.accept( " world " );
```
* `DoubleConsumer`- the consumer receiving the input `Double`;
* `IntConsumer`- the consumer receiving the input `Integer`;
* `LongConsumer`- the consumer receiving the input `Long`.

#### Q. What are the functional interfaces `Supplier<T>`, `BooleanSupplier`, `DoubleSupplier`, `IntSupplier`and `LongSupplier`?
`Supplier<T>`(**provider**) - the interface through which a function is implemented that takes nothing to the input, but returns the result of the class to the output `T`;
```java
Supplier < LocalDateTime > now =  LocalDateTime::now;
now.get();
```
* `DoubleSupplier`- the supplier is returning `Double`;
* `IntSupplier`- the supplier is returning `Integer`;
* `LongSupplier`- the supplier is returning `Long`.
