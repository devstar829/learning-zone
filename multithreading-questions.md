## Multithreading Interview Questions

#### Q. What are the states in the lifecycle of a Thread?
A java thread can be in any of following thread states during it’s life cycle i.e. New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting or Terminated. These are also called life cycle events of a thread in java. 

* New
* Runnable
* Running
* Non-Runnable (Blocked)
* Terminated

**1. New**: The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.  
**2. Runnable**: The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.  
**3. Running**: The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.  
**4. Non-Runnable (Blocked)**: This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.  
**5. Terminated**: A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.  

#### Q. What are the different ways of implementing thread? 
There are two ways to create a thread:
* extends Thread class
* implement Runnable interface

**1. Extends Thread class**  
Create a thread by a new class that extends Thread class and create an instance of that class. The extending class must override run() method which is the entry point of new thread.
```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
     
    public void run() {
      System.out.println("Thread started running..");
    }
    public static void main( String args[] ) {
       MyThread mt = new  MyThread();
       mt.start();
    }
}
```
Output
```
Thread started running..
```
**2. Implementing the Runnable Interface**  
After implementing runnable interface, the class needs to implement the run() method, which is `public void run()`.

* run() method introduces a concurrent thread into your program. This thread will end when run() returns.
* You must specify the code for your thread inside run() method.
* run() method can call other methods, can use other classes and declare variables just like any other normal method.
```java
class MyThread implements Runnable {

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread started running..");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread mt = new MyThread();
        Thread t = new Thread(mt);
        t.start();
    }
}
```

**Difference between Runnable vs Thread**  

* Implementing Runnable is the preferred way to do it. Here, you’re not really specializing or modifying the thread’s behavior. You’re just giving the thread something to run. That means composition is the better way to go.
* Java only supports single inheritance, so you can only extend one class.
* Instantiating an interface gives a cleaner separation between your code and the implementation of threads.
* Implementing Runnable makes your class more flexible. If you extend Thread then the action you’re doing is always going to be in a thread. However, if you implement Runnable it doesn’t have to be. You can run it in a thread, or pass it to some kind of executor service, or just pass it around as a task within a single threaded application.

#### Q. What is the difference between Process and Thread?
Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution. The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.

**Process**  

* An executing instance of a program is called a process.
* Some operating systems use the term **task** to refer to a program that is being executed.
* A process is always stored in the main memory also termed as the primary memory or random access memory.
* Therefore, a process is termed as an active entity. It disappears if the machine is rebooted.
* Several process may be associated with a same program.
* On a multiprocessor system, multiple processes can be executed in parallel.
* On a uni-processor system, though true parallelism is not achieved, a process scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to execute each process one at a time yielding an illusion of concurrency.


**Thread**  

* A thread is a subset of the process.
* It is termed as a **lightweight process**, since it is similar to a real process but executes within the context of a process and shares the same resources allotted to the process by the kernel.
* Usually, a process has only one thread of control – one set of machine instructions executing at a time.
* A process may also be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.
* Multiple threads of control can exploit the true parallelism possible on multiprocessor systems.
* On a uni-processor system, a thread scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to run each thread one at a time.
* All the threads running within a process share the same address space, file descriptors, stack and other process related attributes.
* Since the threads of a process share the same memory, synchronizing the access to the shared data within the process gains unprecedented importance.

#### Q. What is difference between user Thread and daemon Thread?
Daemon threads are low priority threads which always run in background and user threads are high priority threads which always run in foreground. User Thread or Non-Daemon are designed to do specific or complex task where as daemon threads are used to perform supporting tasks.

**Difference Between Daemon Threads And User Threads In Java**  

* User threads are created by the application (user) to perform some specific task. Where as daemon threads are mostly created by the JVM to perform some background tasks like garbage collection.

* JVM will wait for user threads to finish their tasks. JVM will not exit until all user threads finish their tasks. On the other side, JVM will not wait for daemon threads to finish their tasks. It will exit as soon as all user threads finish their tasks.
* User threads are high priority threads, They are designed mainly to execute some important task in an application. Where as daemon threads are less priority threads. They are designed to serve the user threads.
* User threads are foreground threads. They always run in foreground and perform some specific task assigned to them. Where as daemon threads are background threads. They always run in background and act in a supporting role to user threads.
* JVM will not force the user threads to terminate. It will wait for user threads to terminate themselves. On the other hand, JVM will force the daemon threads to terminate if all the user threads have finished their task.

**create Daemon Thread**  
```java
/**
 * Java Program to demonstrate difference beween a daemon and a user thread .
 * 
 */
public class DaemonThreadDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        // main thread is a non-daemon thread
        String name = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        boolean isDaemon = Thread.currentThread().isDaemon();

        System.out.println("name: " + name + ", isDaemon: " + isDaemon);

        // Any new thread spawned from main is also non-daemon or user thread
        // as seen below:
        Runnable task = new Task();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "T1");
        System.out.println("Thread spawned from main thread");
        System.out.println("name: " + t1.getName() + ", isDaemon: " + t1.isDaemon());

        // though you can make a daemon thread by calling setDaemon()
        // before starting it as shown below:
        t1.setDaemon(true);
        t1.start();

        // let's wait for T1 to finish
        t1.join();
    }

    private static class Task implements Runnable {

        @Override
        public void run() {
            Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
            System.out.println("Thread made daemon by calling setDaemon() method");
            System.out.println("name: " + t.getName() + ", isDaemon: " + t.isDaemon());

            // Any new thread created from daemon thread is also daemon
            Thread t2 = new Thread("T2");
            System.out.println("Thread spawned from a daemon thread");
            System.out.println("name: " + t2.getName() + ", isDaemon: " + t2.isDaemon());
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
name: main, isDaemon: false
Thread spawned from main thread
name: T1, isDaemon: false
Thread made daemon by calling setDaemon() method
name: T1, isDaemon: true
Thread spawned from a daemon thread
name: T2, isDaemon: true
```
#### Q. How does thread communicate with each other?
**Inter-thread communication** is a mechanism in which a thread is paused running in its critical section and another thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed. It is implemented by following methods of Object class:

* wait()
* notify()
* notifyAll()

```java
class ThreadA {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
      ThreadB b = new ThreadB();
      b.start();
      synchronized(b) {
       try {
            System.out.println("Waiting for b to complete...");
            b.wait();
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("Total is: " + b.total);
      }
    }
}

class ThreadB extends Thread {
 int total;

 public void run() {
   synchronized(this) {
    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    notify();
   }
  }
}
```
#### Q. What do you understand about Thread Priority?
Every thread in Java has a priority that helps the thread scheduler to determine the order in which threads scheduled. The threads with higher priority will usually run before and more frequently than lower priority threads. By default, all the threads had the same priority, i.e., they regarded as being equally distinguished by the scheduler, when a thread created it inherits its priority from the thread that created it.

Default priority of a thread is 5 (NORM_PRIORITY). The value of MIN_PRIORITY is 1 and the value of MAX_PRIORITY is 10.

* public static int MIN_PRIORITY
* public static int NORM_PRIORITY
* public static int MAX_PRIORITY

```java
class TestMultiPriority1 extends Thread {  
  
    public void run() {  
        System.out.println("Running thread name is:" + Thread.currentThread().getName());  
        System.out.println("Running thread priority is:" + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());  
    }  

    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        TestMultiPriority1 m1 = new TestMultiPriority1();  
        TestMultiPriority1 m2 = new TestMultiPriority1();  
        m1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  
        m2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  
        m1.start();  
        m2.start();  
    }  
}     
```
Output
```
Running thread name is: Thread-0
Running thread priority is: 10
Running thread name is: Thread-1
Running thread priority is: 1    
```
#### Q. What is Thread Scheduler and Time Slicing?
**Thread scheduler** in java is the part of the JVM that decides which thread should run. The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.

**Preemptive scheduling**: The highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead states or a higher priority task comes into existence.

**Time slicing**: A task executes for a predefined slice of time and then reenters the pool of ready tasks. The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factors.

Example: Thread Scheduler
```java
class FirstThread extends Thread {
	public void run(){
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
			System.out.println("I am in first thread");
			try{
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			}
			catch(InterruptedException ie) {
				System.out.println("Exception occurs ");
			}
		}
	}
}

class SecondThread {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		FirstThread ft = new FirstThread();
		ft.start();
		for(int j = 1; j < 10; ++j) {
			System.out.println("I am in second thread");
		}
	}
}
```
Output
```
cmd> java SecondThread
I am in second thread
I am in first thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in second thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
I am in first thread
```
#### Q. What is context-switching in multi-threading?
Context Switching is the process of storing and restoring of CPU state so that Thread execution can be resumed from the same point at a later point of time. Context Switching is the essential feature for multitasking operating system and support for multi-threaded environment.

#### Q. What is Deadlock? How to analyze and avoid deadlock situation?
**Deadlock** is a programming situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, this situation arises with at least two threads and two or more resources.
```java
class HelloClass {
	public synchronized void first(HiClass hi) {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(1000);
		}
		catch(InterruptedException ie) {}
		System.out.println(" HelloClass is calling 	HiClass second() method");
		hi.second();
	}

	public synchronized void second() {
		System.out.println("I am inside second method of HelloClass");
	}
}

class HiClass {
	public synchronized void first(HelloClass he) {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(1000);
		}
		catch(InterruptedException ie){}
		System.out.println(" HiClass is calling HelloClass second() method");
		he.second();
	}

	public synchronized void second() {
		System.out.println("I am inside second method of HiClass");
	}
}

class DeadlockClass extends Thread {
	HelloClass he = new HelloClass();
	HiClass hi = new HiClass();

	public void demo() {
		this.start();
		he.first(hi);
	} 
	public void run() {
		hi.first(he);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		DeadlockClass dc = new DeadlockClass();
		dc.demo();
	}
}
```
Output
```
cmd> java DeadlockClass
HelloClass is calling HiClass second() method
HiClass is calling HelloClass second() method
```
**Avoid deadlock**  

**1. Avoid Nested Locks**: This is the most common reason for deadlocks, avoid locking another resource if you already hold one. It’s almost impossible to get deadlock situation if you are working with only one object lock. For example, here is the another implementation of run() method without nested lock and program runs successfully without deadlock situation.
```java
public void run() {
    String name = Thread.currentThread().getName();
    System.out.println(name + ' acquiring lock on ' + obj1);
    synchronized (obj1) {
        System.out.println(name + ' acquired lock on ' + obj1);
        work();
    }
    System.out.println(name + ' released lock on ' + obj1);
    System.out.println(name + ' acquiring lock on ' + obj2);
    synchronized (obj2) {
        System.out.println(name + ' acquired lock on ' + obj2);
        work();
    }
    System.out.println(name + ' released lock on ' + obj2);
    System.out.println(name + ' finished execution.');
}
```
**2. Lock Only What is Required**: You should acquire lock only on the resources you have to work on, for example in above program I am locking the complete Object resource but if we are only interested in one of it’s fields, then we should lock only that specific field not complete object.

**3. Avoid waiting indefinitely**: You can get deadlock if two threads are waiting for each other to finish indefinitely using thread join. If your thread has to wait for another thread to finish, it’s always best to use join with maximum time you want to wait for thread to finish.

#### Q. What is Thread Pool? How can we create Thread Pool in Java?
A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.

Java provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, its sub-interface –**ExecutorService** and the class-**ThreadPoolExecutor**, which implements both of these interfaces. By using the executor, one only has to implement the Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.

To use thread pools, we first create a object of ExecutorService and pass a set of tasks to it. ThreadPoolExecutor class allows to set the core and maximum pool size.The runnables that are run by a particular thread are executed sequentially.
```java
// Java program to illustrate  
// ThreadPool 
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;  
import java.util.Date; 
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 
import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 
  
// Task class to be executed (Step 1) 
class Task implements Runnable    
{ 
    private String name; 
      
    public Task(String s) { 
        name = s; 
    } 
      
    // Prints task name and sleeps for 1s 
    // This Whole process is repeated 5 times 
    public void run() { 
        try { 
            for (int i = 0; i<=5; i++) { 
                if (i == 0) { 
                    Date d = new Date(); 
                    SimpleDateFormat ft = new SimpleDateFormat("hh:mm:ss"); 
                    System.out.println("Initialization Time for"
                            + " task name - "+ name +" = " +ft.format(d));    
                    //prints the initialization time for every task  
                } 
                else { 
                    Date d = new Date(); 
                    SimpleDateFormat ft = new SimpleDateFormat("hh:mm:ss"); 
                    System.out.println("Executing Time for task name - "+ 
                            name +" = " +ft.format(d));    
                    // prints the execution time for every task  
                } 
                Thread.sleep(1000); 
            } 
            System.out.println(name+" complete"); 
        } 
        catch(InterruptedException e) { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } 
    } 
} 
public class Test 
{ 
     // Maximum number of threads in thread pool 
    static final int MAX_T = 3;              
  
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // creates five tasks 
        Runnable r1 = new Task("task 1"); 
        Runnable r2 = new Task("task 2"); 
        Runnable r3 = new Task("task 3"); 
        Runnable r4 = new Task("task 4"); 
        Runnable r5 = new Task("task 5");       
          
        // creates a thread pool with MAX_T no. of  
        // threads as the fixed pool size(Step 2) 
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_T);   
         
        // passes the Task objects to the pool to execute (Step 3) 
        pool.execute(r1); 
        pool.execute(r2); 
        pool.execute(r3); 
        pool.execute(r4); 
        pool.execute(r5);  
          
        // pool shutdown ( Step 4) 
        pool.shutdown();     
    } 
} 
```
Output
```

**Risks in using Thread Pools**   

* Deadlock
* Thread Leakage
* Resource Thrashing

#### Q. Why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() must be called from inside of the synchronized block or method.?
`wait()` forces the thread to release its lock. This means that it must own the lock of an object before calling the `wait()` method of that (same) object. Hence the thread must be in one of the object's synchronized methods or synchronized block before calling wait().

When a thread invokes an object's `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method, one (an arbitrary thread) or all of the threads in its waiting queue are removed from the waiting queue to the entry queue. They then actively contend for the object's lock, and the one that gets the lock goes on to execute.
